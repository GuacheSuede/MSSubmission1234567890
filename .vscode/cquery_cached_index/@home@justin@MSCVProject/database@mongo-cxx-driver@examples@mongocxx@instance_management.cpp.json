mongocxx::instance constructor and destructor initialize and shut down the driver,\nrespectively. Therefore, a mongocxx::instance must be created before using the driver and\nmust remain alive for as long as the driver is in use.\n\nThis example demonstrates how one might keep a heap allocated mongocxx::instance and\nmongocxx::pool object associated in a way that allows dynamic configuration. Most of the examples\nsimply create a stack allocated mongocxx::instance object, which is fine for small examples, but\nreal programs will typically require shared access to a commonly configured instance and\nconnection pool across different translation units and components. By providing a singleton which\nowns the instance and pool objects, we can defer configuration until we are ready to use MongoDB,\nand share the instance and pool objects between multiple
