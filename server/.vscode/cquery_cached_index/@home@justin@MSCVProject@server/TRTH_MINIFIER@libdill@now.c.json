This optimization can give a huge speedup with old systems.\n1M number is chosen is such a way that it results in getting time every\nmillisecond on 1GHz processors. On faster processors we'll query time\nsomewhat more often but the number of queries should still be\nstatistically insignificant. On slower processors we'll start losing\nprecision, e.g. on 500MHz processor we can diverge by 1ms.","declarations":[],"spell":"95:26-95:29|4|3|2","extent":"95:5-95:49|4|3|0","type":4,"uses":["97:26-97:29|-1|1|4","99:45-99:48|4|3|12","100:5-100:8|4|3|12","101:5-101:8|4|3|12","102:12-102:15|4|3|12"],"kind":13,"storage":1},{"id":7,"usr":13934398243306631899,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["95:33-95:33|-1|1|4","95:33-95:44|-1|1|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":8,"usr":8866110747276091722,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["95:46-95:49|4|3|132"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":9,"usr":16547325177422299480,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["95:33-95:33|4|3|12"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":10,"usr":4236075556702437312,"detailed_name":"uint64_t tsc","short_name_offset":9,"short_name_size":3,"hover":"uint64_t tsc = __rdtsc()","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"96:14-96:17|4|3|2","extent":"96:5-96:29|4|3|0","type":5,"uses":["97:20-97:23|-1|1|4","100:21-100:24|4|3|12"],"kind":13,"storage":1},{"id":11,"usr":14333073009674694694,"detailed_name":"int64_t diff","short_name_offset":8,"short_name_size":4,"hover":"int64_t diff = tsc - ctx->last_tsc","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"97:13-97:17|4|3|2","extent":"97:5-97:39|4|3|0","type":0,"uses":["98:8-98:12|4|3|12","98:18-98:22|4|3|20","98:26-98:30|4|3|12","99:18-99:22|4|3|12"],"kind":13,"storage":1},{"id":12,"usr":13709743979970763221,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["97:31-97:39|4|3|12","100:10-100:18|4|3|20","114:10-114:18|6|3|20"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":13,"usr":5219173030264059093,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["99:50-99:59|4|3|12","101:10-101:19|4|3|20","102:17-102:26|4|3|12","113:10-113:19|6|3|20"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":14,"usr":13226480428104829650,"detailed_name":"struct dill_ctx_now *ctx","short_name_offset":21,"short_name_size":3,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"108:44-108:47|6|3|2","extent":"108:23-108:47|6|3|0","type":4,"uses":["113:5-113:8|6|3|12","114:5-114:8|6|3|12"],"kind":253,"storage":1},{"id":15,"usr":12999532505556159032,"detailed_name":"struct dill_ctx_now *ctx","short_name_offset":21,"short_name_size":3,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"119:45-119:48|7|3|2","extent":"119:24-119:48|7|3|0","type":4,"uses":[],"kind":253,"storage":1},{"id":16,"usr":15419018529832378694,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["27:13-27:23|-1|1|4","85:13-85:23|-1|1|4","112:13-112:23|-1|1|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":17,"usr":3715513493027063108,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["45:13-45:35|-1|1|4","46:18-46:40|-1|1|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":18,"usr":2478375601560079932,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["57:5-57:16|-1|1|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":19,"usr":152188911625004611,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["95:33-95:44|-1|1|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":20,"usr":1319824370131199682,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["99:8-99:17|-1|1|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0}]}
